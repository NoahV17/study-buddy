# Developing your first mainstream application
## Where do you start?
The best place to start when you are developing something brand new is assessing a few different things.

### 1. What is your goal?
Most poeple begin with something in mind, like a problem, that they are attempting to fix
### 2. Are there other apps doing this already?
Unfortunately the answer to that is usually yes. What do you do if someone has created something similar to what you want to create? Think about your purpose, are you doing it for yourself, or to gain from it? If you are creating this for experience feel free to proceed, if you want to gain relevancy in a market you will have to build upon and innovate on that idea. There is always oppourtunity to innovate and make change. Uber Eats, GrubHub, and Post Mates all do very similar things, but they all differenciate themselves in some way which is why they can all compete in the same market and stay alive. 

Now if the answer to that original question for you was no, that's great! It may be a personal portfolio you want to build that solves a personal problem, where the problem is not having a professional portfolio.

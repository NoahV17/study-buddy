## Starting from scratch
From start to completion this is my guide to help out a beginner programmer get started with coding in swift, more specifically in Xcode for watchOS

### Where do you start?
I had no idea where to begin when I came up with the idea to make an app for the apple watch. The first thing I searched was in the realm of "how to code an apple watch app". This is when I learned what the Xcode app was for, and what language I would have to learn to use(swift). Luckily for me swift is not too far from languages I have experience with like Java, Python, and C#.

Note: Xcode is only available on apple systems. Without xcode it makes devolping apple apps much more difficult.

### How I learned... so far
So far the way I've learned how to code in swift is through example code and playing aaround. There are two parts to building a swift app you should be aware of, the code that builds the GUI and the code that runs in the background. I learned how the GUI code works best by just playing around with the static previewer(this unfortunately broke in my case after updating Xcode with the newest mac update) and finding some examples of other peoples code online and messing with that too. When it comes to the rest of the code I am still working on understanding the heiarchy structure of everything but using lots of print() statements help understand what code is running and why it is running. Trial end error, as well as reading online documentation(like in the links above) is your best bet when learning in this case.

### What am I still working on?
Right now I am in the works trying to learn how to update any on screen items live, in reaction to variables updating/ or user interaction.

# Quick start guide to creating your first app
Or at least how I did it

## Starting from scratch
From start to finish, or first product, this is my guide to help out a beginner programmer get started with coding in swift using Xcode.

### Where do you start?
I had no idea where to begin, so if that's where you're at you shouldn't worry. When I came up with the idea to make an app for the apple watch I had no idea at all how to do it, and didn't know that it had to be done in swift. The first thing I searched was "how to code an apple watch app". This is when I learned that Xcode was the main app for developing Apple apps. Xcode is not required but highly reccomended because it has templates and even builds your app in test environments that can be interacted with. And as for the language, swift, I got lucky because is not too far from languages I already have experience with like Java, Python, and C#.

Note: Xcode is only available on apple systems. Without Xcode it makes devolping apple apps more tedius.

### How I learned... so far
How I've gone about learning swift is through playing with example code and watching YouTube videos on writing short blocks of code in swift. There are two parts to building a swift app you should be aware of, the code that builds the GUI and the code that runs in the background. I learned how the GUI code works best by just playing around with the static previewer(this unfortunately broke in my case after updating Xcode with the newest mac update) and finding some examples of other peoples' code online and messing with that too. 
When it comes to the rest of the code I am still working on understanding the heiarchy of everything but using lots of print() statements helps understand what code is running and why it is running. Trial end error, as well as reading online documentation(like in the links above) is your best bet when learning in this case.

### What plans do I have for updates to this app?
Right now unfortunately time is a scarce resource for a solo developer in school full time, so updates are a second though. However, the next goals include trying to add live updating elements on screen.
